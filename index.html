    <li>Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</li>
<li>Chameleon eyes have a 360-degree arc of vision and can see two directions at once.</li>
<li>Chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum. However, chameleons are not deaf. They can detect sound frequencies in the range 200â€“600 Hz.</li>
<li>Chameleons can see in both visible and ultraviolet light.
</li>
